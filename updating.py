Explanation and Next Steps:

Data Models (SQLAlchemy):

Room: Represents a hotel room with its number, current status, and last cleaned time.
Checkout: Stores information about guest checkouts, including scheduled and actual times, and late checkout details.
Housekeeper: Represents a housekeeping staff member.
CleaningTask: Tracks cleaning assignments for specific rooms and housekeepers, along with their status and timestamps.
API Endpoints (Flask):

/rooms:
GET: Retrieves a list of all rooms with their status.
GET /{room_id}: Retrieves details of a specific room, including checkout history.
PUT /{room_id}: Updates the status of a room (e.g., checked_out, cleaning, clean).
/checkouts:
POST: Records the actual checkout time for a room.
/checkouts/{checkout_id}/late:
PUT: Allows a guest to request a late checkout.
/checkouts/{checkout_id}/approve_late:
PUT: Allows staff to approve or deny a late checkout request.
/housekeepers:
GET: Retrieves a list of all housekeepers.
/cleaning_tasks:
POST: Assigns a cleaning task to a housekeeper for a specific room.
/cleaning_tasks/{task_id}:
PUT: Updates the status of a cleaning task (pending, in_progress, completed).
Basic Functionality: The code provides basic endpoints for retrieving room information, updating room status, recording checkouts, handling late checkout requests, managing housekeepers, and assigning/updating cleaning tasks.

Further Development:

PMS Integration: Implement the crucial integration with the hotel's Property Management System to get real-time checkout data and potentially update stay information. This would likely involve making HTTP requests to the PMS API or interacting with its database.
Authentication and Authorization: Add security to your API endpoints to ensure only authorized users (hotel staff) can access and modify data. This could involve token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling to catch potential exceptions and provide informative error responses.
Validation: Add input validation to ensure the data received by the API is in the correct format and meets the required criteria.
Real-time Updates (WebSockets): Integrate WebSockets to push real-time updates to the frontend (e.g., room status changes) without the need for constant polling.
Task Prioritization Logic: Implement more sophisticated logic for automatically prioritizing cleaning tasks based on factors like early check-ins or late checkouts.
Housekeeping Mobile App: Develop the frontend for the housekeeping staff, allowing them to view assignments, update room status, and potentially communicate with supervisors.
Frontend for Front Desk/Management: Create the web interface for managing rooms, checkouts, late checkout requests, and viewing reports.
Testing: Write unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of your code.
Deployment: Plan for how you will deploy and host your application.
This code provides a starting point for your backend API. Building the complete application will require significant effort in developing the frontend interfaces, implementing the PMS integration, adding security, and refining the business logic.
