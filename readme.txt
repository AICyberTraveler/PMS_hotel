Core Functionality:

Checkout Tracking:

Integration with PMS (Property Management System): How will your application receive real-time checkout information? Will it be through an API, database integration, or another method? Ensure secure and reliable data transfer.
Visual Mapping: How will you visually represent the status of rooms (e.g., checked out, cleaning in progress, clean and ready)? Consider a floor plan view or a list-based view with clear color-coding.
Estimated Checkout Times: Can the system incorporate estimated checkout times based on booking information or guest requests?
Late Checkout Requests: How will guests request late checkouts through the app or other channels, and how will these requests be managed and approved by hotel staff?
Housekeeping Management:

Task Assignment: How will housekeeping staff receive and manage their cleaning assignments? Consider individual logins, mobile notifications, and the ability to mark tasks as completed.
Room Status Updates: How will housekeeping staff update the status of rooms (e.g., "cleaning in progress," "clean") in real-time?
Prioritization: Can the system prioritize rooms based on factors like early check-ins or guest requests?
Reporting and Analytics: What kind of reports will be valuable for hotel management (e.g., cleaning times, staff efficiency, room turnaround times)?
Extended Stay Management:

Late Checkout Approval Workflow: How will hotel staff review and approve or deny late checkout requests based on availability and hotel policies?
Automatic Fee Calculation: If late checkout fees apply, how will the system calculate and potentially integrate with billing?
Room Availability Updates: How will the system ensure that extended stays are accurately reflected in room availability for new bookings?
Technical Considerations:

Platform: Will this be a web application, a native mobile application (iOS and/or Android), or a hybrid approach? Consider the needs of both hotel staff (likely mobile) and potentially guests (if they can request late checkouts through it).
Technology Stack: What programming languages, frameworks, and databases will you use? Consider factors like scalability, maintainability, and your team's expertise.
API Integrations: Identify the necessary APIs for PMS integration, potential payment gateways (for late checkout fees), and any other relevant systems.
Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive guest and hotel data.
Scalability: Design the application to handle a growing number of users and data as the hotel or hotel chain expands.
User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX): Ensure intuitive and efficient interfaces for both hotel staff and potentially guests. Consider different user roles and their specific needs.
Real-time Updates: How will you implement real-time updates for room status and task assignments? Consider technologies like WebSockets.
Offline Capabilities: For housekeeping staff using mobile devices, consider how the app will function in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.
Potential Features to Enhance the App:

Maintenance Requests: Allow housekeeping or other staff to easily submit maintenance requests for rooms.
Inventory Management: Track cleaning supplies and allow staff to request refills.
Communication Tools: Integrate a communication feature for staff to coordinate (e.g., between front desk and housekeeping).
Guest Communication: If guests can use the app, consider features like viewing their checkout time or requesting services.
Analytics Dashboard: Provide a comprehensive dashboard for hotel management to monitor key metrics.
Key Questions to Ask Stakeholders:

What are the biggest pain points in the current checkout and cleaning process?
What are the specific needs and workflows of the housekeeping staff?
What are the hotel's policies regarding late checkouts?
What level of integration with the existing PMS is possible and desired?
What are the budget and timeline constraints for this project?
